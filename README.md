![Plant Recognition Logo](https://yourimagelink.com/logo.png)

**Plant Recognition** is a web application designed to help users identify plant species using machine learning. This application allows users to upload plant images, which are processed to return the most likely species along with additional information. The project leverages modern web technologies, including **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, for a highly responsive and scalable app.

## 🚀 Features

### 📸 Image Upload and Processing
- Users can upload an image of a plant via an intuitive UI.
- The application is designed to process images efficiently and provide accurate identification results using a machine learning model (to be integrated).

### 🧠 Machine Learning Integration
- In the future, this project will integrate a **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** model to identify plant species with high accuracy.
- The model will be trained on a diverse dataset to support a wide variety of plants globally.

### 🌐 Responsive and Accessible Design
- The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices, ensuring users have a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.
- Follows **WCAG** accessibility guidelines to ensure inclusivity for all users.

### 🛠️ Key Technologies
- **Next.js**: A full-stack React framework enabling server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
- **React**: Component-based UI development for dynamic user experiences.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a **component-based architecture** with a clean separation of concerns:

- **PlantIdentifier.tsx**: This is the core component responsible for managing image uploads, calling the recognition API, and displaying results.
- **layout.tsx**: The layout component provides a consistent structure, including the header, footer, and content area across all pages.
- **page.tsx**: This component renders the home page, where users interact with the plant recognition feature.
- **globals.css**: Contains the global CSS settings, importing Tailwind's base styles, and customizing theme variables for a cohesive look and feel across the app&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
